# Stock-Market-Prediction-And-Forecasting-Using-Stacked-LSTM

Hello, connections! I'm excited to show my latest project named Stock-Market-Prediction-And-Forecasting-Using-Stacked-LSTM. 📈💼

In this project, I've covered several essential topics related to stock market analysis. Let's break down the key points with appropriate emojis:

1. *Data Exploration* 📊
   - I started by exploring the dataset containing historical stock market data, including Open, High, Low, Close prices, Total Trade Quantity, and Turnover (Lacs).

2. *Data Preprocessing* 🧹
   - I performed data preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values and checking for data types.

3. *Data Visualization* 📉📊
   - Visualized the closing and opening prices over the years to understand the market trends.

4. *Correlation Analysis* 📈📉
   - Conducted a correlation analysis to identify relationships between different variables in the dataset.

5. *Machine Learning Model* 🤖
   - Developed a machine learning model using Stacked LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict stock market prices.

6. *Model Training and Evaluation* 🧠📈
   - Trained the model with historical data and evaluated its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error.

7. *Data Scaling* ⚖️
   - Utilized Min-Max scaling to normalize the data for better model training.

8. *Data Splitting* 📊➗
   - Split the data into training and testing sets for model validation.

9. *LSTM Model Architecture* 🏗️
   - Designed a sequential LSTM model with multiple layers for improved accuracy.

10. *Model Summary* 📋
    - Provided a summary of the LSTM model architecture and its parameters.

11. *Model Training* ⌛
    - Trained the model on the training data for multiple epochs to learn from historical patterns.

12. *Model Evaluation* 🧾
    - Evaluated the model's performance on the testing data, highlighting its accuracy.

Stay tuned for more exciting projects! 🚀📈💰
